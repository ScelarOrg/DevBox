## Fetch-style frameworks

Use the response helpers with Hono, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Elysia, or any framework that accepts a standard `Response`:

```ts
import {
  serveSW,
  servePreviewBridge,
  servePreviewBridgeScript,
} from '@scelar/nodepod/server';

app.get('/__sw__.js', () => serveSW());
app.get('/__nodepod_bridge__.html', (context) =>
  servePreviewBridge(context.req.raw));
app.get('/__nodepod_bridge__.js', () => servePreviewBridgeScript());
```

## Express, Fastify, or `node:http`

Node-native helpers return a body and header map:

```ts
import { serveSWNode, servePreviewBridgeNode } from '@scelar/nodepod/server';

app.get('/__sw__.js', async (_request, response) => {
  const { body, headers } = await serveSWNode();
  for (const [name, value] of Object.entries(headers)) {
    response.setHeader(name, value);
  }
  response.status(200).send(body);
});
```

The bridge helpers return the response body and headers, so mount both paths
using the same response-writing pattern. For the HTML bridge, forward a
`mode=top` or `mode=parent` query when your preview host uses the top-level
bootstrap handoff. The complete Express example is in [Preview deployment](/Nodepod/docs/setup/preview-deployment/).

Only route the documented Nodepod paths to these handlers. Your application remains responsible for authentication, caching policy outside those paths, and wildcard preview-host routing.
