# Documentation launch checklist

The Nodepod documentation site is live at
`https://r1ck404.github.io/Nodepod/`. The repository uses GitHub Pages with a
manual `workflow_dispatch` deployment while website changes remain under
review.

## Current state

- Landing page, Starlight docs, generated API reference, and reduced terminal demo are public.
- Generated API source links are recreated during every docs build and pinned to the build revision.
- The Sponsors profile is still pending GitHub approval. Do not publish funding metadata until it is active.

## Sponsors launch gate

- Confirm `https://github.com/sponsors/R1ck404` is an approved, active GitHub Sponsors profile.
- Confirm the monthly tiers are active: $5 Supporter, $25 Backer, and $100 Company sponsor.
- Confirm GitHub's custom one-time amount is enabled.
- Confirm no tier promises an SLA, priority issues, private support, or early repository access.
- Only then add `.github/FUNDING.yml` and the root package `funding` field.
- Do not add an empty sponsor logo wall.

## Release checklist

1. Run `pnpm run docs:check` under Node.js 22.12 or newer.
2. Run `pnpm run docs:test` and review the Playwright report and screenshots.
3. Review the landing page, docs search, API source links, terminal demo, mobile layout, light/dark modes, and reduced motion.
4. Manually run `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml` from `main`.
5. Verify the canonical site, docs search, API pages, terminal demo, metadata, and sponsor status.
6. Enable an automatic deployment trigger only after the manual workflow is stable and the desired change paths are agreed.
